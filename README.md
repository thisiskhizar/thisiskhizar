# Hi, I'm Khizar 👋 👩🏾‍💻

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thisiskhizar/thisiskhizar/master/gh-header-image.jpg" alt="banner that says Muhammad Khizar - Full Stack Developer">

I’m a Full Stack Engineer with 2+ years of experience building robust, end-to-end web and mobile applications. With a background in CS Engineering, I specialize in designing scalable, high-performance solutions across both frontend and backend — using technologies like React.js, Next.js, React Native, Node.js (Express/Nest), Django, FastAPI, and databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL. I focus on delivering clean, efficient code and intuitive user experiences, whether I'm building RESTful APIs, microservices, or full-stack platforms. My goal is to create real impact through reliable, production-ready software.
